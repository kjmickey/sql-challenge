# sql-challenge
 
### Step one of this homework required:
    examining CSV's
    designing SQL DB tables with the proper relationships
    properly importing CSV's into the tables.
    
I could not figure out how to import the CSV's via code in hte PGAdmin query window, so I did it the inefficient way using right clicking and file selection.  This is something I need to figure out when there's no time pressure.    

### Step two required writing SQL queries to extract data to answer 8 questions.
    Number 4 was the most difficult to write.  
    6 and 8 appeared difficult in a vacuum, but were #4 with a bit of extra code.

### Step three (bonus) required manipulating the data via python queries.  
I am not sure I'll get to this part of the assignment.

### Structure of this repository

    The data files are in /EmployeeSQL
    the ERD diagram is called **ERD Diagram.png**
    ** pewletthackard.sql ** is the table setup file
    **SQLqueries.sql** is where the actual homework questions were answered.
